Partitions v. 0.3 Beta is a tool for compositional or analytical tasks of Partitional Analysis. It is a program aimed at composers, researchers in music, mainly texture and form, and those interested in understanding Partitional Analysis and its derived theories. Its applications include:

- Formal and textural analysis;
- Identification of copyright traits common to the repertoires of one or more composers;
- Comparison with other types of analysis (harmonic, rhythmic) to deduce structural relationships;
- Analysis of orchestration and distribution of instruments;
- Analysis of melodic structures.

Version 0.3 Beta is in the testing phase, and we offer it as an open-source program.
# Basic Instructions
_Partitions_ program interface consists of three panels: _Data_, _Tables_, and _Nets_. 
## Density-number
The first step is to choose a density-number, referent to the number of voices, instruments, lines or simultaneous elements. After entering the number in the _n_ field, the fields _p_ (number of integer partitions) and _Lexsum_ (number of elements of lexset) automatically update.
## Tables
Clicking on the _Partitions_ or _Lexset_ buttons gives the list of partitions or the lexical set correspondents to the density-number. The results shows up in the bottom area.
## Nets
Clicking on the buttons of Nets Panel gives the nets formed by the three basic relations inside the partitiograma - _resizing_ (M), _revariance_ (V), and _transference_ (T). The G button gives an glance of all nets at once.
These nets can be used to assess the transformations or progressions between textural configurations of a selected piece, or as a tool for compositional planning.
